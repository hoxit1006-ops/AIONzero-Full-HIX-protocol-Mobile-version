# HIX Protocol (Expo Go Ready)

This project is configured to run as a standard Expo app using `App.js` as the entry screen.

## Quick start (Expo Go)

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start Metro:

```bash
npx expo start
```

3. Open with Expo Go on your phone by scanning the QR code.

## Useful commands

```bash
npm run start
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
```

## Notes

- Main app file: `App.js`
- Entry registration: `index.js`
- Expo config: `app.json`

If you later want file-based routing with Expo Router, generate it explicitly and add the required router dependencies before introducing `app/` route files.
